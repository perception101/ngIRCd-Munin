ngIRCd Graphs for Munin

Some very basic scripts to monitor users, servers, channels and operators on an
ngIRCd server.

Based on an original script by Martin Weinelt
   here -> http://exchange.munin-monitoring.org/plugins/ircd/version/1
   
Requires: PHP-CLI

ABOUT

There are three scripts which collect essentially the same information, it's
likely you will either use ngircd_sessions, or both ngircd_global and 
ngircd_local (although that will result in some duplicate data).

ngircd_sessions counts global users, servers, channels and operators as well
as local users and servers.

ngircd_local only counts local users and servers, but still counts global
channels and operators.

ngircd_global only counts global users and servers, along with global channels
and operators.

Obviously you can easily remove duplicate data if you wish.

INSTALLATION

1. Copy the required scripts (or link to them) from your munin plugins
directory, for example, /etc/munin/plugins.

2. Recycle the munin-node process.

CONFIGURATION

Each script requires the same configuration information, which
unfortunately has to be made in the actual script at present.

$_nick - set this to the nick you want the script to use.
         Note that if you intend to install this script on more than one host
		 to check several IRC servers in the same network, you should ensure
		 this value is unique.  If you intend to run multiple instances of the
		 script from one host, to check several IRC servers, it does not need
		 to be unique.  This is the recommended way to do it, otherwise you
		 may end up counting Munin processes on other hosts in the IRC network.
		 
$_host - set to the correct protocol and IP address.

$_port - set to the correct port for the IRC server in question.

$_pass - if the IRC server requires a password upon connection, set it here,
         otherwise leave this variable empty.

FUTURE

1. Update the script to check multiple IRC servers
2. Consider changing to perl with Net::Telnet
3. Consider using a single script and changing the output using
   a munin environment setting.
